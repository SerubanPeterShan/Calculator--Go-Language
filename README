# Calculator Package

This is a simple calculator package that demonstrates basic Go testing practices.

### Participant

## Package Contents

- `calculator.go`: Contains the main package functions
- `calculator_test.go`: Contains the test cases

### Available Functions

1. `Divide(a, b int) (int, error)`
    - Performs integer division
    - Returns error if division by zero is attempted

2. `square(a int) int`
    - Returns the square of a number
    - Internal function (not exported)

## Running Tests

### On Mac/Linux:

```powershell
cd /path/to/project
go test -v
```

### On Windows :

```bash
cd \path\to\project
go test -v
```

## Why No main.go?

We don't need a `main.go` file because:

1. This is a package meant to be imported by other programs
2. Go's testing framework provides its own entry point for tests
3. The `go test` command automatically detects and runs test files

## Test Coverage

The test file includes:

- Division test with valid input
- Division by zero test
- Square function test
- (Commented) Addition test for future implementation

To check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

## Notes

- Files must be in the same directory
- Test files must end with `_test.go`
- Each test function must start with `Test`
